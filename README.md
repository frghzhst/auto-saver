# auto-saver
backs up directory of your choice automatically.
quite self explanitory.
process monitering so everyting you close a specific process that you put in, it backs up your target directory, you can enter "null" to not use the process monitering.
autosave saves byte by byte, autobackup only backs up, so autobackup only goes one version back while you can choose the save from autosave, the save file in byte is also massive, so only save small directories and backup huge directories.
